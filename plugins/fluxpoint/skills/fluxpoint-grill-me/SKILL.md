Read `../../commands/grill-me.md` relative to this skill and perform its
workflow. The user's request supplies the goal. Claude Code reaches that
command through `/fluxpoint:grill-me`; Codex reaches it through this skill.
The Claude-only frontmatter keys prevent duplicate menu entries there.

Use the same packet and decision protocol in either runtime. If an optional
question tool is unavailable, present the model's baseline and continue
authorized work. Genuine authorization requirements still need the user's
answer. Never infer approval from a default or a missing reply.
