# Seam ratchet: a mock of code you own is an unverified contract.
#
# The property is narrow: the count of module mocks may fall and never rise,
# first-party and third-party tracked apart because they fail differently.
# What matters most is what is NOT counted — a stub of the process boundary is
# the thing this ratchet is trying to push people toward, so counting it would
# punish the fix and train people to ignore the check.
#
# Executed end to end: every case builds a real repo, runs the real script, and
# reads the real exit code and baseline file.
