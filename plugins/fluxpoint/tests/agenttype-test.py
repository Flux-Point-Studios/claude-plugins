"""agentType: the name that does not resolve, and the name that resolves wrong.

Two failure modes, reported from opposite ends, wanting opposite fixes.

An UNRESOLVABLE name fails at the worst possible node: `agent type not found`
is raised at the spawn, so a gate late in the graph pays for it only after
everything upstream has run. But the agent namespace is not closed from the
compiler's position -- agents resolve from every installed plugin and from
built-in types it cannot enumerate -- so rejecting on a partial view would
refuse valid IR. That one is a warning, emitted before the first spawn.

A name that RESOLVES to an agent whose answer shape contradicts the node's
contract is the expensive one: the agent is real, it runs, and it answers in
a schema the node cannot accept -- while possibly holding the campaign's only
haltWhen. That is provable from what the compiler can see, so it is rejected.

The line between them is the property under test, and the shipped templates
are the regression that keeps the rejection honest.
