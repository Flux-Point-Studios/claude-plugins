# The hygiene scan may be narrowed. The gate that ARMS it may not.
#
# fpl_scan_hygiene greps whole UNTRACKED files while the tracked branch three
# lines above takes only added lines, so a design-tool export or a vendored
# sample that predates the session blocks every stop in the repo, on code
# nobody in this session wrote. .gitignore scopes that, but a file you intend
# to commit LATER has no correct lever: gitignoring it is wrong and committing
# it early to silence the gate is worse.
#
# The dangerous fix is the obvious one. _fpl_skip_path is shared with
# fpl_code_dirty, the predicate that arms the gate, so a repo-extensible skip
# list wired there would let `src/**` in a file switch the DoD gate off
# silently. The property under test is that the new list narrows the SCAN and
# cannot disarm the GATE.
