# Interpreter resolution, against the shape that actually breaks it.
#
# The property under test: a name on PATH is not evidence of an interpreter.
# Windows ships a `python3` App Execution Alias, enabled by default, on
# machines with no python3 installed at all. It satisfies `command -v`, and
# then prints "Python was not found; run without arguments to install from
# the Microsoft Store" and exits 49 for EVERY argument shape. A resolver that
# picks by name therefore selects a program that cannot run anything, and
# under `set -euo pipefail` the caller dies at its first use with only the
# Store's own string as the diagnostic.
#
# Two halves, because the defect had two lives. The behavioural half runs the
# real scripts/py.sh with a mimic alias first on PATH. The structural half
# asserts no copy of the resolver has regressed to the name test — there are
# twenty of them, and one reverted copy is a Windows repo that cannot run its
# own harness.
