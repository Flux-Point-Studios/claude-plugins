#
# The honest claim under test is narrow, so the tests are too. It is NOT
# "a row cannot be forged" — WORK.md is a markdown file both the PostToolUse
# hook and the hygiene scan skip, so an agent can type anything into it.
# It is: the Stop hook records its own verdict, that class is visibly
# distinct, and a fresh context is handed agent assertions labelled as
# assertions rather than as evidence.
#
# Also pinned here: `plugin_script` used to kill `harness.sh --full` outright
# in any repo where ~/.claude/plugins does not exist — find exits 1, pipefail
# propagates it, set -e ends the run — which is precisely the case the
# function exists to support.
