"""The proof-auditor's verdict reaches the record (issue #72).

"Treat WEAKENED as harness-red" was a sentence in a command file. Nothing
typed it, no graph node could bind the agent that says it, and the
Evidence row had no cell for it — so a feature campaign could run build ->
red-team -> green with no proof ever audited and the table read clean.

ProofV1 makes the verdict a contract; this pins what record-run.py does
with one, executed against the real script:
  - WEAKENED files the run BLOCKED-PROOF, and a flag cannot talk it back
  - UNPROVEN files it INCOMPLETE: the declared verification did not run
  - NOT-APPLICABLE leaves the outcome alone and says why in the Proof cell
  - SOUND over an empty surface is named as vacuous, never as reviewed
  - a run recorded before contracts were emitted still derives the verdict
  - the shipped feature template carries the unified header the row needs
