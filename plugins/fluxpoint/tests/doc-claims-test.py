"""The docs may not promise a guarantee the code does not provide.

Three claims went stale in the direction that matters -- each described a
property the reader would rely on, and each was false against the shipped
code. A doc that overstates a guarantee is worse than one that says nothing,
because the reader stops looking.

Pinned here so they cannot drift back:
  - the irreversible ledger is gitignored, so it cannot be described as
    committed and cannot promise once-only across clones
  - attestation records passes and (measured) never reds, so the log's own
    docstring must count that among its limits
  - record-run must distinguish a node claiming green with no row from one
    claiming red with no row, because only the first is suspicious
