"""Hybrid recall: the properties that make it safe to trust.

Executed, not inspected: every case builds a real store in a scratch git
repo, runs the real build and the real pipeline, and asserts on what came
out. The invariants worth pinning, in order of blast radius:

  * Determinism. The index is a projection; projecting twice from the same
    sources must be byte-identical, or resume/diff/review all rot.
  * Source discipline. A malformed line in memory.jsonl or a run artifact
    is a hard error, never a skipped row — an index built over a silently
    shrunk store believes it is standing on more ground than it is.
  * Advisory-only. Killed lessons are retrieved and labelled, never
    filtered; the seedmap shape matches memory.py --load exactly, so the
    compiled graph's empty-dedup-set contract survives untouched.
  * Named degradation. Keyless, stale-index, and index-absent modes each
    say what they are; none of them errors, and none is silent.
