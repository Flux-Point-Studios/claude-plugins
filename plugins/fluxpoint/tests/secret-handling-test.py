"""The secret-handling skill's shapes, executed against a canary.

A skill that says "never leak the key" is prose, and nothing checks prose.
The shapes it teaches are code, so they are extracted from SKILL.md and run
here against a file whose entire contents are a canary string. Then the only
question that matters gets asked: did the canary reach any output.

Every case carries its control — the naive shape the skill exists to
replace, asserted to LEAK. A leak detector that cannot detect a leak passes
on an empty document, which is how a doc test rots into decoration.

The traceback cases render with traceback.TracebackException(
capture_locals=True), which is the stdlib renderer pytest --showlocals is
built on. That is the vector the real incident turned on: nothing printed
the key, a frame merely held it, and rendering the frame printed it in
full.

The headline box is run in a shell, as a reader would run it, because the
shape with the most readers used to be the only shape nothing executed —
and it leaked the whole seed phrase the first time a key file failed to
parse. That needs `bash` on PATH, which the rest of this suite needs
anyway.
