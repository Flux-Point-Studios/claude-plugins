# 540s ceiling: the gate times out, yields after $max blocks -- and then re-runs
# the entire suite on EVERY subsequent stop, paying full wall-clock to reach a
# conclusion it has already abandoned. The operator's only escape was Esc.
# Yielding is a decision about a tree; it must hold until that tree changes.
#
# The run witness lives OUTSIDE the repo on purpose. A counter file inside it
# is part of `git status`, so writing to it moves the very tree hash the guard
# compares -- the first draft of this test failed for exactly that reason and
# the guard was innocent.
