"""Splice one Evidence row, for a caller that already holds the verdict.

Loop rows were written by the agent whose work they certified. The obvious
fix — a script the agent runs that executes a gate and mints a row — is
worse than it looks: a subprocess an agent launches inherits the agent's
environment, cwd, and PATH, so it cannot outrank the agent that launched
it. It would have been a fourth full harness run per iteration for
provenance no stronger than the hand-written row it replaced.

The witness already exists. `dod-gate.sh` is a Stop hook: the *runtime*
invokes it, at the moment the agent claims to be done, and it already
re-runs `scripts/harness.sh --full`, holds the exit code, the log, and the
tree state, and already distinguishes PASS from FAIL from TIMEOUT. What was
missing was not another writer — it was a reader. So the gate writes its own
row, and this script is the writer it calls: it executes nothing.

  evidence.py --record --source gate --outcome PASS \\
      --claim "..." --proof "..." [--graph WORK.md]

## The property this actually establishes

Not "a row cannot be forged". `WORK.md` is a markdown file that
`verify-changed.sh` and the hygiene scan both skip, so an agent can write
any text into it, including a `gate` row, and nothing here prevents that.

What it establishes is narrower and real: **there is now a row class an
honest agent never writes.** A `Source: gate` row is authored by a Stop
hook or it is authored by nobody, so a `gate` row appearing in a diff
without a corresponding gate run is a reviewable anomaly — and
`inject-state.sh` renders the two classes differently, so a fresh context
inherits agent assertions labelled as assertions rather than as evidence.
That is a review affordance, not a containment boundary, and the difference
is worth stating rather than blurring.
