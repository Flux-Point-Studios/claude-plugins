"""Proof-strength ratchet: escape hatches may go down, never up.

A prover's exit code is a much better signal than "the code looks right",
which is why this harness is well suited to verified work. But exit 0 does
not mean what it looks like. Every proof assistant ships a way to make a
goal go away without proving it — `todo` in Aiken, `assume` and `{:axiom}`
in Dafny, `sorry` in Lean, `Admitted` in Coq, `#[verifier::external_body]`
in Verus — and a checker exits 0 just as happily on an assumed lemma as on
a discharged one. An agent asked to "make the proof pass" will find those.

So the count of escape hatches is recorded in a committed baseline and this
script fails when any category rises. Weakening a proof stops being a
judgment call and becomes a diff someone has to justify. Going the other
way is always allowed: proving something you previously assumed lowers the
count, and `--baseline` re-records it.

  proof-guard.py --scan       report current counts and where they are
  proof-guard.py --baseline   record counts to .fluxpoint-proof-baseline.json
  proof-guard.py --check      fail if any category rose above the baseline

Dormant by design: a repo with no proof-language files exits 0 in silence,
exactly like the DoD gate in a repo with no harness.

Two weakenings add no hatch at all, so both are counted structurally by
matching braces and reading the body — but only where the body is
unambiguous, because a false positive here would train people to ignore
the ratchet:

  * Gutting a test. `test t() { True }` still runs, still passes, and
    asserts nothing, so no line-based scan can see it.
  * Discharging a condition by fiat. `fn credential_matches(o, k) -> Bool
    { True }` moves an obligation into a helper that always agrees — the
    validator still reads as if it checks something, and the count of
    `todo`/`expect` never moves.

Known misses are pinned by tests rather than assumed covered — a `when x
is { _ -> True }` is vacuous but needs real expression analysis to see, so
this does not claim it.

What remains beyond counting: a theorem whose statement lost a conjunct, a
property proved about an unreachable state, a generator that cannot produce
the interesting case, a solver `unknown` read as success. Those need
judgment, and they are the `proof-auditor` agent's job — run
`/fluxpoint:proof-audit`, which does both passes. A ratchet is a floor,
not a ceiling.
