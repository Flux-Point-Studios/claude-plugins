"""Counterexample ledger: a prover's failing input outlives the run that found it.

The most valuable thing a prover ever produces is the shrunk input that
breaks the property. It is minimal, concrete, and reproducible — and it
lives in a log file the next command overwrites. So the same bug is
rediscovered, re-shrunk, and re-explained from scratch, and a fix ships
with no permanent evidence that the case it fixed is still handled.

This records it, and makes the fix permanent:

  cex.py --ingest --tool T --from FILE --exit N   record failures from prover output
  cex.py --pin <cexId>                     write the evidence and a draft
  cex.py --pin <cexId> --file F --test-name T   record the regression test
  cex.py --check                           a pinned counterexample still bites
  cex.py --retire <cexId> --reason "..."   release the ratchet, with a diff
  cex.py --list                            what is recorded, for humans

The store is `.fluxpoint-cex.jsonl` at the repo root, next to
`.fluxpoint-proof-baseline.json` and `.fluxpoint-pairs.json` and for the
same reason: it is a ratchet, so it has to be committed. Everything under
`.claude/fluxpoint/` is gitignored by this plugin's own installer, and a
ratchet nobody else can see is a ratchet that only fails on the machine
that found the bug.

## Provers

One ledger, one pinning discipline, one parser per prover. `TOOLS` is a
registry: each entry knows how to read that prover's output into rows and
how to read a regression test written in that prover's language. The
ledger, the containment rule, the refusal to mint a counterexample from a
green test, and the INGEST-FAILED inbox row are shared, and a second parser
must not relax any of them.

### aiken

There is no `--json`. Aiken picks its output listener at runtime: when
stdout is not a TTY it emits structured JSON and sends every diagnostic to
stderr. A plain redirect therefore yields the machine form for free, and
nothing here parses a terminal box. The published `--show-json-schema` is
wrong in two ways that break a schema-driven parser — it declares a `kind`
discriminator that is never emitted, and names the array `test` where the
real key is `tests` — so kinds are told apart by which fields are present.

### dafny

`dafny verify` prints one line per failed obligation —
`file.dfy(LINE,COL): Error: <what could not be proved>` — and, when run
with `--extract-counterexample` (legacy `/extractCounterexample`), a block
headed `Counterexample for first failing assertion:` made of state blocks:
a location line `file.dfy(LINE,COL): initial state:` followed by indented
`name : type = value` lines, one state per program point. Dafny 4 renders
the same model as `assume name == value && ...;` statements meant to be
pasted into the code. The parser reads both spellings and keeps the
`initial state` block, which is the method's inputs — the shrunk-input
equivalent. Dafny extracts a model for the FIRST failing assertion only;
later failures are recorded without one. A `Counterexample` heading with no
assignment under it is parser drift and files INGEST-FAILED rather than
reading as a run with no failures. Resolution and type errors also print
as `Error:` lines; only messages that name a verification failure ("could
not be proved", "might not hold", …) become rows.

### kani

`cargo kani` prints, per harness, a `RESULTS:` block of numbered checks
(`Check 3: my_harness.assertion.1` / `- Status: FAILURE` / `- Description:
"…"` / `- Location: src/lib.rs:12:5 in function my_harness`), a `Failed
Checks:` summary with a `File: "…", line N, in <fn>` line, and a verdict
line `VERIFICATION:- FAILED` (or `SUCCESSFUL`). With `-Z concrete-playback
--concrete-playback=print` it also prints a generated Rust unit test
introduced by ``Concrete playback unit test for `my_harness`:`` whose
`concrete_vals` vector carries one `// <value>` comment per input (the
interpreted value, in order) above the raw bytes `vec![…]`. The run ends
with a `Summary:` block: `Verification failed for - <harness>` per failure
and `Complete - N successfully verified harnesses, M failures, T total.`
One row per failed harness; the comment values are the recorded input
(`255, 1` — Kani does not name them), and the byte vectors are kept as an
alternative spelling so the test Kani itself writes into the source under
`--concrete-playback=inplace` is a legal pin. A build error prints no
verdict line at all and records nothing, said aloud. A `Complete` line
counting more failures than rows were extracted is parser drift.

### apalache

`apalache-mc check --inv=Inv Spec.tla` exits 12 on a violation
(`EXITCODE: ERROR (12)`) and names the trace files on stdout — any line
carrying a path ending in `.itf.json` is read, and `--from` may point at
the ITF file itself. ITF (Informal Trace Format): `#meta` (with `source`
and `description`), `vars`, and `states`, each state a map from variable
to value with `#meta.index`; values are plain JSON scalars or the tagged
forms `{"#bigint": "…"}`, `{"#set": […]}`, `{"#map": [[k, v], …]}`,
`{"#tup": […]}`, `{"#unserializable": "…"}`, and records as plain
objects. One row per trace; `input` renders every state in order
(`x = 1, y = {1, 2} ; x = 2, y = {1, 2, 3}`), and containment is judged on
the FIRST state — the initial-state block is the shrunk-input equivalent
here as it is for Dafny, and a TLA+ regression is written as an `Init`
constrained to it, not as a paste of the whole trace.

## What a pin has to survive

`--pin` cannot write the regression test itself: the recorded value does
not carry the test's parameter type or the predicate it broke, so a
generated test would be a guess, and a wrong guess is a non-compiling file
dropped into a source tree that was merely red. The agent writes the test;
this tool refuses to record it unless the recorded value is physically in
it. Specifically, a pin is rejected when:

  * the file is untracked, outside a directory the prover compiles (Aiken:
    `lib/`, `validators/`, `env/`; Dafny: any tracked `.dfy`; Kani: any
    tracked `.rs`; Apalache: any tracked `.tla`), or under `.claude/`
    (where this tool writes its own draft — a tool must not mint the
    artifact that satisfies its own check),
  * the named test inverts or disables the oracle: an Aiken test annotated
    `fail`, which passes *because* the predicate is broken and goes red the
    day someone fixes it; a Dafny declaration carrying `{:verify false}` or
    `{:axiom}`, or a body containing `assume`, which makes anything verify;
    a Rust fn under `#[should_panic]` or `#[ignore]`, or one with neither
    `#[test]` nor `#[kani::proof]`, which nothing ever runs; a TLA+
    operator introduced by `ASSUME`, which the checker takes as given,
  * the recorded literals are absent from that test's own body, in order,
    on token boundaries — not merely somewhere in the file, where a
    counterexample of `0` or `True` would match by accident,
  * or the body is hollow: a bare boolean, a self-comparison, a value bound
    and then ignored (`let v = <value> True`), or an `assert true`.

Comments and string literals are stripped before any of that, or pasting
the value into a comment would satisfy it. For Kani and Apalache each
string literal is replaced by a digest of its contents rather than
blanked, and a string-valued leaf is digested the same way before the
search: a `pc = "L1"` state stays pinnable, and still nothing else can
hide inside a string.

## What this does NOT claim

A pinned test is recorded as *containing* the counterexample. It is not
re-run against the un-fixed code to prove it would have caught it. That is
the honest gap, it is why `signature` is in the schema already, and it is
the next increment — until then a pin means "the evidence is in the tree",
not "the regression bites".
