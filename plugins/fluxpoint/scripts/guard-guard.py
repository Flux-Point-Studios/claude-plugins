"""Guard ratchet: a safety guard must be provable, and proven guards may only go up.

The companion to proof-guard.py, which counts the ways a proof can be waved through.
This counts the opposite thing: guards that stop money moving wrongly, and whether
each one is actually held down by a test.

WHY. Three guards failed the same way inside one week, on the same product:

  - a validator's fee bound had never been evaluated by a ledger, because every
    on-chain proof took the client-escape branch and short-circuited before reaching it
  - a tool deciding what a client is asked to WITNESS had a suite that went red the day
    the thing it guards changed shape, and nothing ran it for a fortnight
  - a co-signer's deployed-key pin had NO test in any commit, so a refactor deleted it
    along with the module it sat in and 95 tests still passed

None of these was a bug in the guard. Each was a guard nobody could see was gone. A
guard whose only proof lives in the file being refactored dies with it in silence, and
a green suite is what you get either way.

WHAT THIS DOES THAT A CHECKLIST DOES NOT. Registering a guard costs nothing and rots
quietly, so --verify does the thing by hand nobody keeps doing: it DISABLES each guard,
runs the one test that names it, and requires that test to FAIL. A guard whose proof
still passes with the guard disabled is decoration, and this says so. That is the whole
mechanism; everything else is bookkeeping around it.

  guard-guard.py --scan       list registered guards and their proofs
  guard-guard.py --check      fast: every guard and proof still present, count >= floor
  guard-guard.py --verify     slow: mutate each guard, require its proof to redden
  guard-guard.py --baseline   record the current count as the floor

--check belongs in every CI run; it is a grep and costs nothing. --verify runs the test
suite once per guard, so it belongs wherever the full suite already runs.

MANIFEST (.fluxpoint-guards.json), committed beside the code:

  {"guards": [
    {"id": "cosigner-deployed-key-pin",
     "protects": "serving an unpinned key produces addresses no client can rebuild",
     "guard":  {"file": "server.py", "contains": "if self.vkh != pinned_vkh:"},
     "proof":  {"file": "test_signer_pin.py",
                "test": "test_a_key_that_does_not_match_its_pin_is_fatal"},
     "mutation": {"find": "if self.vkh != pinned_vkh:", "replace": "if False:"},
     "expect": "does not match its pin",
     "run": "{py} -m pytest -q {file}::{test}"}
  ]}

`protects` is prose and is never parsed. It is there because the next person to read a
failure needs to know what the guard was FOR, and a rule nobody understands gets deleted.
