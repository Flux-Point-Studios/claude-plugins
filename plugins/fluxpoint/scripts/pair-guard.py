"""Relation gate: check artifact PAIRS, not artifact health.

The Stop gate has two evidence channels — a harness exit code and a regex
over added lines — and both measure one artifact in isolation. That misses
an entire defect class, because the expensive failures are *relationships*:

    An on-chain predicate is tightened. Its off-chain transaction builder
    is not. Every test passes, on both sides, because each artifact is
    individually correct — and the change rejects 100% of honest
    transactions.

No count of passing tests can see that. The suite is green precisely
because nothing in it evaluates the pair together.

So the pair is declared, in a repo-owned `.fluxpoint-pairs.json`, and
checked three ways:

  co-change     A commit that moves one side of a declared pair and not the
                other is reported. Cheap, catches the common case, and says
                nothing about whether the two sides *agree* — only that
                somebody changed one and forgot the other.
  parity        A command whose job is to build the off-chain artifact and
                evaluate the on-chain one against it, so the relation itself
                becomes an exit code. This is the real check; co-change is
                the smoke alarm.
  differential  The parity nobody has to hand-roll: a generator emits
                inputs, both implementations run over every one, and any
                difference in exit code, stdout OR stderr — byte for byte,
                error text and key order included — is a divergence. Seven
                rounds of review on one keeper found every HIGH in a
                hand-written reader that "delegated to the same code"; two
                hand-rolled comparisons got it wrong before a differential
                settled it (52,869 documents, 0 differences).

An acknowledgement clears CO-CHANGE, never parity. `.fluxpoint-pair-acks.json`
holds `{pair, source_sha, why}`; `source_sha` addresses the CURRENT bytes of the
source files the alarm named, so editing them again makes the ack stale and the
alarm re-opens on its own. That is the difference between recording that someone
read the mirror and switching the alarm off.

## A parity that cannot fail is not a parity

A parity command that passes because it compares nothing is indistinguishable
from one that passes because the artifacts agree — the same false green
`guard-guard.py` refuses for guards. So a pair may declare a `bite`: a
mutation of the reader (`file`, `find`, `replace`, optional `compile`), and
`--verify` proves the parity intact, mutates the reader, requires the parity
to go RED, and restores — reading the file back after both the write and the
restore, because an anchor that misses is a silent no-op that looks exactly
like a survivor, and a restore that did not restore leaves every later
measurement running against a mutant. The `compile` exit is printed on its own
line every time: under a test runner that compiles in a global setup, a mutant
that does not compile reports zero failures and reads as a survivor.

`--check` and `--list` name a parity with no bite ("nothing has shown it can
fail"); `--verify` fails it. Like `guard-guard.py --verify`, this belongs
off-session, on a Routine, where the full suite already runs.

## Authority

`source` and `mirror` read as symmetric, and the defect is not: one side is
the funds-moving path and the other is a reader of it. `authority: "source"`
(or `"mirror"`) names which, so a divergence is reported as *the reader
diverged from the authority* rather than *they differ*, a `bite` is refused
when it would mutate the authority to prove a reader notices, and `--scan`
knows which direction a suggested pair runs.

## Undeclared mirrors

Nobody declares a mirror they do not know they wrote. `--scan` proposes them
from three cheap, high-signal heuristics over the tracked and untracked code:
the same non-trivial error message thrown from two modules; two modules whose
thrown-message sets overlap; and a comment or docstring claiming to mirror or
delegate to another module ("same code", "mirror of", "as the keeper does").
Output is a JSON list of suggested manifest entries on stdout with the
evidence in each `why`, exit 0 always — a suggestion, never a gate. The
parity, differential and bite are the repo's to write.

  pair-guard.py --check              co-change over the diff, then parity + differential
  pair-guard.py --check --against origin/main    diff a branch, for CI
  pair-guard.py --verify             prove every parity bites (mutate, RED, restore)
  pair-guard.py --scan               propose undeclared mirrors as manifest entries
  pair-guard.py --list               what is declared, and what is not

Differential protocol: the generator runs once with FPL_PAIR_SEED and
FPL_PAIR_CASES in its environment and prints one case per line (opaque bytes;
one JSON document per line is the recommendation). Each case is written, with
a trailing newline, to the stdin of `sourceRun` and `mirrorRun`, and the two
(exit, stdout, stderr) triples must be identical. No normalisation exists on
purpose: a command that needs to canonicalise does it inside the command,
where the choice is reviewable. `--seed` and `--cases` override the manifest
so a divergence is reproducible from the line that reported it; the
FPL_PAIR_CASES environment variable caps the count so a harness can size the
run.

Dormant by design: no manifest means no declared relations, exit 0.
