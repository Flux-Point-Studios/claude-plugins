"""Seam ratchet: a mock of code you own is an unverified contract.

`vi.mock('@/services/x')` does not test anything about `@/services/x`. It
asserts what the author BELIEVED that module does, and nothing ever checks
the belief. When the belief is wrong the suite stays green — not because
the code works, but because the test never reached it.

That is not a hypothetical. The campaign that produced this script shipped
eight defects of one shape into a feature with a green, mutation-verified
suite: the unit was correct and the thing that reaches it was not. Four
were invisible until the ledger, the compiler or an adversarial reader
refused. The measured cause was a suite that mocked its own modules three
to one over real boundaries.

Mutation testing does not catch this. A mutant only reddens a test whose
input reaches the mutated line, so a suite that mocks the caller reports
the same green either way.

So the count is recorded in a committed baseline and this script fails when
it rises. Adding a mock stops being a reflex and becomes a diff someone has
to justify — and the honest justification is usually a wire test instead.

  seam-guard.py --scan       report current counts and where they are
  seam-guard.py --baseline   record counts to .fluxpoint-proof-baseline.json
  seam-guard.py --check      fail if any category rose above the baseline

Two categories, because they fail differently:

  first_party   mocking a module in this repo. The contract is one you own
                and could have tested for real; the mock asserts a shape
                you are free to change without anything noticing.

  third_party   mocking a library. Worse in one specific way: you are
                asserting a shape someone ELSE controls, from memory. Every
                one of the eight defects above lived here — the CBOR tag
                shape, the ledger's escaping, the error class a wallet
                throws. A library's real output is a capture, never a
                recollection.

Dormant by design: a repo with no test files exits 0 in silence, exactly
like the DoD gate in a repo with no harness.

Deliberately NOT counted, because each is a real boundary rather than a
contract you could have verified:

  * `stubGlobal('fetch')`, `window.*`, `globalThis.*` — the process edge.
  * a partial mock — a factory that reaches back through importActual,
    requireActual, or vitest's importOriginal helper keeps the real module
    in the graph, so the contract is still exercised. Judged PER CALL:
    one partial mock in a file must not exempt a wall-off mock of a
    different module sitting beside it, or a single importActual would
    buy unlimited uncounted walls for the rest of that file's life.

Comments are stripped before matching, the same discipline as
proof-guard: `// we deliberately do not vi.mock('@/wallet') here` is the
opposite of a mock, and counting it fails the ratchet on exactly the diff
that explains a fix.
