# Wake parked campaigns whose blocking condition has cleared.
#
# A blocked node is not a stalled one. A 72h governance timelock, an
# operator wallet with no spendable UTxOs, a multi-day reward soak — the
# condition clears on its own schedule, and polling it by hand is exactly
# the "constantly check back in and nudge" this is meant to remove.
#
# Each parked wait carries a predicate the repo wrote. This runs the ones
# that are due, and reports which campaigns are ready to resume. It does
# not resume them itself: re-invoking a graph is an action with a budget
# and, potentially, an irreversible node behind it, so a human or an
# explicitly-configured Routine makes that call.
#
#   wake-check.sh            run due checks, report what is ready
#   wake-check.sh --all      ignore the interval and check everything now
#
# Exit 0 always unless a wait file is malformed: this is a poller, and a
# check that is simply not ready yet is not an error.
