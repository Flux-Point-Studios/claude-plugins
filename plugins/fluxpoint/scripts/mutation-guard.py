"""Mutation score: the judge of the judge.

Every other gate in this plugin asks whether the tests pass. None of them
asks whether the tests can fail. In loop-mode TDD the same agent writes the
code and the thing that grades it, and `proof-guard.py` only catches the
unambiguous vacuities — a body that is literally `True`, a predicate that
always agrees. A suite that executes every line and asserts nothing about
any of them is green, structurally clean, and worthless.

Mutation testing is the one measure that cannot be faked by executing code:
break the implementation on purpose, and count how many broken versions the
suite notices. A test that never fails kills no mutants.

  mutation-guard.py --measure [--accept --reason "..."]   run it; enforce the ratchet
  mutation-guard.py --check                               cheap gate: is there a fresh measurement
  mutation-guard.py --report                              what was measured, for humans

## Why the work is split this way

A mutation run takes minutes to hours — it compiles and tests the project
once per mutant — so it cannot be a per-stop gate. `--measure` is the
expensive half and is where the ratchet lives: it re-measures, and fails
when the score fell or the survivor count rose against what was recorded.
Run it off-session, on the wake/Routine layer. `--check` is the cheap half
that belongs in `harness.sh --full`: it re-runs nothing and only asks
whether a measurement exists and still describes this tree.

Both directions of the ratchet matter. Score is a ratio, and a ratio can be
held flat while coverage shrinks — delete a well-tested module and the
survivors that remain are a smaller share of a smaller whole. So the
absolute survivor count is ratcheted too: it may fall, never rise.

## Loud, not fatal, where it cannot know

A repo with no `.fluxpoint-mutation.json` is dormant and silent, like the
DoD gate with no harness. A repo that declares one but has never measured
is reported NOT MEASURED and still exits 0 — arming a ratchet is a
deliberate step, exactly as in `proof-guard.py`. A measurement that has gone
stale is named, with how stale, and files an inbox item so somebody
schedules the re-run; it fails the build only if the config asks for it.
That default is not timidity: a gate that goes red because an expensive job
has not been re-run yet is a gate people switch off, and it would take the
rest of the harness with it.

Coverage: `cargo-mutants` today. Other toolchains are declared unsupported
by name rather than silently skipped, because a mutation guard that quietly
measures nothing is worse than none at all.

The adapter reads `mutants.out/outcomes.json` and never the tool's stdout —
`--json` on cargo-mutants affects only `--list`, so stdout stays human text
even when asked for JSON. It was written against the schema of 27.1.0 and
refuses an older one rather than misreading it, because fields have been
renamed and collapsed between releases.

Three shapes are real output that would otherwise publish a fake number,
and each is refused by name:

  * A failed baseline still writes an `outcomes.json` — full of zeroes. Read
    as counters it looks like a clean sweep of a project with no mutants.
  * `cargo mutants --check` only compiles mutants. Every one is filed
    `Success`, nothing is caught or missed, and the tool exits 0: a green
    mutation gate that measured nothing.
  * `unviable` mutants did not compile. Scoring them would report 0% for a
    tree the tool itself considers perfectly clean.

And the `outcomes` array is not a list of mutants: it includes the baseline
run, whose `scenario` is the bare string `"Baseline"` where every mutant's
is an object. The top-level counters are the source of truth here for
exactly that reason.
