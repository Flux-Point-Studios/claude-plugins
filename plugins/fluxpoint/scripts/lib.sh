#
# THE PROJECT DIR KEEPS JURISDICTION WHENEVER IT IS ITSELF INSIDE A GIT WORK
# TREE: single-repo sessions, and projects scoped to a subdirectory of a larger
# repo. These hooks are the gate for ONE project, and a session's cwd is
# wherever its shell last cd'd — a dependency checkout, a sibling repo, a
# scratch git init. A Stop gate that followed the cwd there would conclude
# "harness absent" about a repo it was never the gate for, delete the real
# project's arming marker, and wave the stop through — a plain cd would disarm
# the gate, which is the one thing it must never do.
#
# THE PAYLOAD'S OWN cwd WINS only when the project dir cannot be the repo. In a
# MULTI-REPO WORKSPACE the project dir is the workspace root, deliberately not a
# git repo, while the command ran inside one of the repos beneath it — and that
# repo is where the manifests, the harness and the state directory live.
# Resolving the project dir first landed outside every repo and exited before
# reading anything, so attestation, the DoD gate and the per-edit harness were
# all silently dormant for the whole workspace. (secret-guard resolves cwd
# first unconditionally, and rightly: it judges the COMMAND, and the command
# ran in the cwd. These hooks judge a PROJECT.)
#
# Then climb to the git toplevel, because a gate is often run from a
# subdirectory while the artifacts it is judged against sit at the repo root.
# The climb only happens on the workspace path, so it can never walk out of a
# project that sits below a bigger repo's toplevel. Outside a repo, stay put
