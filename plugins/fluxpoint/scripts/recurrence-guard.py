"""A lesson learned twice is not a lesson. It is a missing gate.

WHY. The lesson store had both halves of this and never joined them.
Identity is `tag|dedupeKey` with latest-state-wins, so the second time a run
found the same thing the new row REPLACED the old one; the consolidate pass
then merged near-duplicates into a single canonical claim. The third time the
system learned a thing, the store looked exactly as it had the first time.
Recurrence was not merely uncounted — the only place that counted it spent
the number on a retrieval ranking boost and told nobody.

The measured case: a deploy recipe carried a hand-typed list of the modules
to package. Three separate rounds each found a different module missing from
it, each fix was correct, and the whole service went down every time, because
knowledge was never the problem. Knowledge was written down three times.
Nobody joined the three instances into one class, because that join needed a
human to notice two unrelated repos rhyming in the same week.

WHAT THIS DOES. Past the threshold an item stops being addressable by
restating it. It demands a HarnessCheckV1 — a command whose exit code is that
lesson's live verdict — registered in .fluxpoint-recurrence.json and EXECUTED
here, not reported. Until that command runs and exits as declared, the item
stays loud at every session start and the harness stays red.

  recurrence-guard.py --check        gate: every recurrence has a passing check
  recurrence-guard.py --scan         humans: what has recurred, and how often
  recurrence-guard.py --for-session  the SessionStart line; always exits 0

THE THRESHOLD IS TWO, and it is not configurable. Once is learning. Twice is
a pattern, and on the measured history a gate at two would have demanded the
check on the second occurrence — ahead of the third and fourth, which are the
ones that took the service down. At three it would have fired after the
outage it exists to prevent. One is not a threshold at all: it would demand a
harness check for every lesson ever filed, and a gate that fires on
everything is one people learn to skim. A knob here would only ever be turned
one way.

MANIFEST (.fluxpoint-recurrence.json), committed beside the code:

  {"checks": [
    {"identity": "defect-sweep|hand-maintained-enumeration",
     "command": "python tools/package.py --verify",
     "expectExit": 0,
     "why": "derives the package from the import graph and imports the built
             artifact in isolation, so a missing module cannot ship"}
  ]}

`identity` is an exact `tag|classKey` or `tag|dedupeKey`. No globs: one
pattern covering everything is how a gate becomes decoration.

WHAT THIS CANNOT DO, stated because a check that overclaims is worse than
none: it proves the registered command RAN and exited as declared. It cannot
prove the command would have caught the defect. Prove that separately —
guard-guard.py --verify disables a guard and requires its proof to redden,
which is the mutation this gate has no way to perform on an arbitrary repo.
